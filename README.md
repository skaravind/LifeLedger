# LifeLedger

A blockchain based appllication that holds the data and identity of users securely for hassle-free verification at institutes like banks, colleges and others.

The blockchain can be verified by a bitcoin-like consensus rule and the data is verified using the **proof of existence** protocol.

The addition of new data to the identity block is done by the authorities itself and whenever a user wants to send some parts of his data to a firm, he can do so by scanning a QR code at the firm and selecting the required docs in the pop up he gets in his/her device. The firm confirms the "transaction" and verification is done in **drastically lesser time** than the conventional processes.
